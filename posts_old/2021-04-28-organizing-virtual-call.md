title: call for an Organizing Committee for the online component of FPSAC 2021
---

Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, there will not be an in person FPSAC event during the originally scheduled July dates. The organizers will be publishing the proceedings for FPSAC'21 as planned, by the dates of the original conference, July 5â€“9, 2021.

Together with the local organizers in Israel, we are planning to have an in-person component in early 2022, as well as a virtual component, and are currently considering options for the virtual component.

We are placing a call for proposals for a virtual event and looking for members who are willing to dedicate time, energy, ideas and expertise to showcase the content of the conference and foster exchanges.  This could be as minimal as collecting and publishing online posters and videos of the talks or it could be something more interactive.

There is a very tight timeline for our call;  if you are interested in helping to organize an online event for FPSAC 2021, please send your ideas to proposal.2021@fpsac.org by May 5.
