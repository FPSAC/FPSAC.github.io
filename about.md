FPSAC/SFCA is a series of annual international conferences on Formal
Power Series and Algebraic Combinatorics (Séries Formelles et
Combinatoire Algébrique), first held in Lille (France) in 1988.

The continuing success of this series stems in part from its
considerable interdisciplinary breadth, linking leading researchers
in combinatorics with mathematicians in allied fields
drawn from pure mathematics, applied mathematics, theoretical computer
science, physics, and biology. This is unique among international
conferences with an emphasis on combinatorial mathematics.

The principal topics featured during FPSAC conferences are algebraic
and enumerative combinatorics and their applications and relations
with other areas of mathematics, physics, biology and computer
science. This interdisciplinary nature is reinforced by the choice of
plenary speakers.

A second distinguishing characteristic of FPSAC conferences is the
concerted effort to recognize and encourage outstanding young
mathematicians.  This is achieved by ensuring that at least one
plenary speaker is an "emerging" star, by making special
efforts to have talented young researchers represented among the
contributed talks and posters, and by annualy awarding a best-student
prize.

A third distinguishing characteristic of the FPSAC conferences is to
emphasize inclusiveness among participants. The conference seeks to draw 
substantial participation from groups which have been traditionally
under-represented in the mathematical sciences, as well as to promote
international participation; both English and French have been
designated as official languages for the conferences.
