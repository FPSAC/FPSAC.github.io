FPSAC/SFCA is a series of annual international conferences on Formal Power Series and Algebraic Combinatorics (Séries Formelles et Combinatoire Algébrique), first held in Lille (France) in 1988.

The continuing success of this series stems in part from its considerable interdisciplinary breadth, linking leading researchers in combinatorics with mathematicians in allied fields drawn from pure mathematics, applied mathematics, theoretical computer science, physics, and biology. The principal topics featured during FPSAC conferences are algebraic and enumerative combinatorics and their applications and relations with other areas of mathematics, physics, biology and computer science. This interdisciplinary nature is reinforced by the choice of plenary speakers.

FPSAC emphasizes inclusiveness among participants. The conference seeks to draw substantial participation from groups which have been traditionally underrepresented in the mathematical sciences, as well as to promote international participation.  The changing conference location and line-up of plenary speakers are thoughtfully chosen to support this agenda, as well as the publication of extended abstracts of all accepted submissions. 

A key and distinguishing feature of FPSAC conferences is the strong tradition of fostering the next generation of algebraic and enumerative combinatorialists.  To recognize and encourage outstanding junior mathematicians,  at least one plenary speaker is an “emerging” star, organizers make special efforts to have talented junior researchers represented among the contributed talks and posters, and a best-student prize is awarded annually.  FPSAC is a platform for students and early career researchers to present and discuss their work, and for researchers of all generations to mix and network during the conference.  For these reasons, FPSAC emphasizes in-person participation at its conferences.  Though the aim is for all presentations to be in-person, FPSAC recognizes that there are people who cannot travel due to structural or personal circumstances and encourages local organizers to make the talks available to all.
