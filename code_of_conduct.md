The FPSAC community is committed to providing a rewarding and welcoming
experience for all. We are committed to ensuring that FPSAC is professional
and free of harassment and discrimination in all of its events.

We are dedicated to create a supportive environment that benefits from the
diversity of experiences of all its participants. We aim to offer equal
opportunity and treatment to every participant regardless of their mathematical
experience, gender identity, nationality, race or ethnicity, religion, age,
marital status, sexual orientation, disability, or any other factor.

We will not tolerate any form of discrimination or harassment and we expect
attendees of conferences to behave in a professional manner. If you experience
harassment or discriminatory behavior at a conference event, we encourage you
to reach out to any member of the Executive Committee or the Organizing Committee
so we may take appropriate actions to address the situation.

If you witness harassment or discriminatory behavior, please consider
intervening. We need the whole community to work together to make this event
the welcoming and rewarding experience for all that we strive to achieve.

Thank you for your cooperation.
