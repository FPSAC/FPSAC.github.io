title: Virtual presentation of talks and posters of accepted submissions
---

Recognizing the fine work resulting in so many great submissions,
and the completion of the refereeing and selection process,
**this is a call for volunteers and proposals.**

Regrettably, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is not possible for
FPSAC to take place physically in Israel in 2020. After discussions
with the FPSAC executive committee, the local organisers have decided
to focus their energy on the publication -- as originally planned --
of all accepted submissions as a special FPSAC'20 issue of the
SÃ©minaire Lotharingien de Combinatoire, and the organisation of a
future FPSAC edition in Israel. The presentation of plenary speakers
will be postponed to this future edition.

Many of you may wonder about holding FPSAC'20 online in some virtual
form: presenters have been looking forward to showing their work through
talks and posters, and the community is eager to see them.

We have a creative community, and many of you have gained technical
and social experience in online activities. We are looking for members
who are willing to dedicate time, energy, ideas and expertise to showcase
the content of the conference and foster exchanges.  This could be as
minimal as collecting and publishing online posters and videos of the
talks or it could be something more interactive.

Please discuss with others, sharpen your proposal, and get in touch by
sending an email to **[proposal.2020@fpsac.org](mailto:proposal.2020@fpsac.org)**.

These exceptional times call for pragmatism; nevertheless, proposals
should address how to respect the participants personal data and
enable forms of participation for our fellows with limited internet
bandwidth.

Given the cancellation of a physical conference, participants will be
given the option to withdraw their submission if they do not wish it
to be published in SLC. Online participation will be optional.


The very tight timeline is:

**May 8**: Deadline for expressing interest in techical support of the project and for
submissions of initial written ideas for presentations.

**May 11**: Videochat with everyone to present and discuss the ideas.

**May 13**: Deadline to compile one or more short proposals, possibly with overlapping teams.

**May 15**: Final decision.
