---
It has been a sad year for the FPSAC community to receive the news that
[Georgia Benkart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Benkart) has died.
She worked in Lie Algebras and combinatorial representation
theory.  She retired from teaching from the Univerisity
of Wisconsin--Madison in 2006, but has been active in service for organizations such as
[American Mathematical Society](https://www.ams.org/)
and the [Association for Women in Mathematics](https://awm-math.org/).

The Notices of the AMS published an article by
Arun Ram and Tom Halverson in March 2022 titled
"[Gems from the Work of Georgia Benkart](https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/202203/rnoti-p375.pdf?adat=March%202022&trk=2447&cat=interest&galt=none&utm_source=Informz&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=March%20%20notices&_zs=0p2BH1&_zl=8klc6)"
