title: Journal of Algebraic Combinatorics flips to Fair Open Access
---

Another milestone toward Open Science has been reached by the FPSAC community
with the [Journal of Algebraic Combinatorics](https://link.springer.com/journal/10801)
being revived as [Algebraic Combinatorics](http://algebraic-combinatorics.org)
that will be run according to Fair Open Access Principles.
For details, see this [Press Release](http://www-users.math.umn.edu/~reiner/AlgebraicCombinatricsPressRelease.pdf).
