title: "Open call for future FPSAC organization"
---
Starting with FPSAC 2027, we invite interested groups of researchers to apply for the organization of FPSAC.

The FPSAC venue selection is done at least three years in advance by the Executive Committee (EC) to ensure smooth operation of a conference of this size and for timely compliance with grant deadlines.

The selection process takes into consideration a wide range of factors including geographic balance, community growth, historical context, and robust on-site resources.

There are several necessary conditions, any future FPSAC organizer must be aware of:

* Organizing FPSAC is a major task that spans multiple years.
* It requires many active organizing and program committee members.
* The organizers must be able to coordinate and provide a number of key conference aspects.<br/>
  In terms of space, these include
  * a lecture hall for several hundred participants,
  * facilities for coffee breaks, and
  * a hall for poster sessions.<br/>
  In terms of participant amenities, these include
  * affordable housing options/recommendations,
  * provisions for coffee breaks,
  * reliable internet connectivity,
  * maps and recommendations for local travel and entertainment,
  * a banquet, and
  * an excursion.
* Besides collecting the conference fees, the organizers must be able to raise additional external funding, with the support of the EC.

If you have questions concerning the procedure or otherwise, please contact the EC at [executive@fpsac.org](mailto:executive@fpsac.org).
