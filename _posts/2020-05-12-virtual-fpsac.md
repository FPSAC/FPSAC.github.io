title: Announcements regarding FPSAC 2020 - 2023
---

**The ongoing Coronavirus epidemic forced us to cancel the physical FPSAC 2020 meeting.**

The organizing committees for all three years kindly agreed to shift the venues by one year.
Together with the current program committee and the executive committee, they agreed on the following plan:

* **virtual FPSAC 2020, July 6 - July 24:** The submitters of the accepted talks and posters will be asked to present their work at a virtual FPSAC meeting.
  Within these three weeks we will have three sessions a week:
  * **Mondays at 2pm UTC**
  * **Wednesdays at 10pm UTC**
  * **Fridays at 6am UTC**

  Details will be announced on a newly installed website soon.

* **FPSAC 2021, July 5-9 in Ramat-Gan (Israel):** The organizing committee will form a new program committee to handle the new call for submissions. All invited speakers of FPSAC 2020 agreed to give their presentation in Ramat-Gan in 2021.

* **FPSAC 2022 in Bangalore (India):** Dates will be announced in due time.

* **FPSAC 2023 in Davis (US):** Dates will be announced in due time.
