title: Have ideas to improve this site? You can help!
---

This website has been designed to be maintained collaboratively, with
a wiki-style model. It's built statically from sources in the
lightweight Markdown syntax
([example](_post/2017-07-20-site-help.md)), with as much as possible
of the information stored as metadata
([example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FPSAC/FPSAC.github.io/master/_confs/fpsac-2018.md))
which makes it easy to reuse and reformat. Technically speaking, this
uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and the sources are hosted on
[github](https://github.com/FPSAC/FPSAC.github.io).

Here are some ways you can help:

- **Content**: Spotting a typo or some text that can be improved?
  Please click on "Edit this page", and submit (it's called a pull
  request in the github jargon). Or fill in an
  [issue](https://github.com/FPSAC/FPSAC.github.io/issues). If you
  don't have a github account, you can also send your suggestion by
  e-mail to `executive@fpsac.org`.

- **Conferences:** Have you organized one of the FPSAC conferences?
  Please check the information, and report or fix directly any mistake
  as above.

- **Artwork:** there are so many beautiful visual artefacts in our
  community. It's a shame that none is displayed on this site.
  Suggestions welcome!

- **News:** Do you have important news for our community? Get in
  touch; we could add a post on this site.
