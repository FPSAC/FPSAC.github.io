title: "Combinatorial Theory: a new mathematician-owned and fully open access journal"
---

I am writing to inform you of an exciting development: a new journal,
Combinatorial Theory <http://math.sfsu.edu/beck/ct>, which is
mathematician-owned, and fully open access, with no charges for
authors or readers.

  I hope that you will regard this new journal as the successor to the
Elsevier-owned Journal of Combinatorial Theory Ser. A (JCT A).  The
majority of the JCT A editorial boards have recently notified Elsevier that
they will not be renewing their contracts, and will resign after December
2020;  this includes all of the Editors-in-Chief whose contract does not
extend past that date. Daily operations for the new journal will be run by
interim editors until 2021, so that editors can fulfill any contractual
obligations to Elsevier before joining the new journal.

  To aid the success of this venture, I encourage you to do the following.

1. Please do not submit any new papers to JCT A.  Papers already in the
pipeline at JCT A will be processed as before.  Send *new* papers of the
same scope and quality to Combinatorial Theory via email to
combinatorial.theory@gmail.com.

2. If you are contacted by Elsevier to serve as an editor for JCT A, please
do not accept, as this will hurt our efforts.

Sincerely,

Victor Reiner

Interim Editor, Combinatorial Theory <http://math.sfsu.edu/beck/ct>
