title: "Death of Vera Sós"
---
We are sad to announce that number theorist and combinatorialist
[Vera Sós](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vera_T._S%C3%B3s) has
died.  She taught at Eötvös Lorand University for more than 50 years, starting
in 1952, and she was active in service to the mathematical community through
the János Bolyai Mathematical Society. Vera Sós was an invited speaker at
FPSAC 2014 in Chicago, although she was ultimately unable to attend.

Announcement from the [Hungarian Academy of Sciences](https://mta.hu/english/mathematician-vera-t-sos-full-member-of-mta-passes-away-112816).
