---
We are sad to announce that the number theorist and
combinatorialist [Vera Sós](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vera_T._S%C3%B3s)
died in March 2023.  She taught at Eötvös Lorand University for more than 50
years starting in 1952.  She was an invited speaker at FPSAC 2014 in Chicago
(although she it ended up that she was unable to attend).

Announcement from the [Hungarian Academy of Sciences](https://mta.hu/english/mathematician-vera-t-sos-full-member-of-mta-passes-away-112816).
