title: "Death of Christine Bessenrodt"
---

The FPSAC community is mourning the loss of Christine Bessenrodt, a long time contributer to the field of algebraic
combinatorics.  Her work focused on combinatorial representation theory, symmetric and quasisymmetric functions
and additive number theory.
Christine Bessendrodt held the Chair of Algebra and Number Theory at The University of Hannover since 2002.
She was an invited speaker at FPSAC 2005 in Taoramina, Italy and she served on the program committee
for FPSAC conferences on several occassions.
