Congratulations to June Huh (Princeton University) for winning the Fields Medal.
The Fields Medalists were announced at a ceremony in Helsinki by the IMU this week.
June Huh was an invited speaker at FPSAC'14 that was held in Chicago.

The other medalists were Hugo Duminil-Copin (Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques),
James Maynard (University of Oxford) and Maryna Viazovska (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology).

Huh was awarded the Fields Medal "[f]or bringing the ideas of Hodge theory to combinatorics, 
the proof of the Dowling–Wilson conjecture for geometric lattices, 
the proof of the Heron–Rota–Welsh conjecture for matroids, 
the development of the theory of Lorentzian polynomials, 
and the proof of the strong Mason conjecture."
